## Technical Achievements

### 1. Function Signature Alignment

- **Issue**: Mismatched function signatures between contracts and test files
- **Resolution**: Updated all test cases to match actual contract implementations
- **Impact**: Eliminated 15+ signature-related test failures

### 2. Ethers.js Version Compatibility

- **Issue**: Tests using ethers v6 syntax with ethers v5 environment
- **Resolution**: Updated all `ethers.keccak256` and `ethers.toUtf8Bytes` calls to use `ethers.utils.*`
- **Impact**: Fixed 8 syntax-related failures

### 3. Return Value Handling

- **Issue**: Tests expecting primitive values but receiving structured objects
- **Resolution**: Updated assertions to access correct object properties (e.g., `reputation.overallScore`)
- **Impact**: Resolved tuple return value access issues

### 4. Token Ownership Validation

- **Issue**: Tests attempting to use skill tokens not owned by the specified users
- **Resolution**: Corrected skill token ID assignments and ownership validation
- **Impact**: Fixed contract-level ownership validation errors

### 5. Oracle Cooldown Management

- **Issue**: Tests failing due to oracle operation cooldown periods
- **Resolution**: Added proper time advancement between oracle operations
- **Impact**: Eliminated cooldown-related test failures

## Performance Metrics

### Gas Usage Analysis

- **Mint Skill Token**: 375,492 gas
- **Create Pool**: 459,819 gas
- **Submit Application**: 397,394 gas

### Contract Size Verification

- **SkillToken**: 23.28 KB (within limits)
- **TalentPool**: 22.41 KB (within limits)
- **Governance**: 22.61 KB (within limits)
- **ReputationOracle**: 21.42 KB (within limits)

### Test Execution Time

- **Total Suite**: ~39 seconds
- **Individual Contract Tests**: 7-10 seconds average
- **Integration Tests**: 8-12 seconds

## Security Validations

### Access Control

✅ Role-based permissions properly enforced  
✅ Only authorized addresses can execute privileged operations  
✅ Admin role management working correctly

### Reentrancy Protection
